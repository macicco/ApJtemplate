\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{introduction}

This is an introductory section.  Start with some broad background and,
as you advance, give more specific details concerning your research.
Usually, the last paragraph of the introduction details the content in
the rest of the sections.

In Section \ref{sec:observations}, we describe observations, show some
examples of how to cite other papers.  In Section
\ref{sec:dataanalysis}, we describe our data analysis, show a Figure
example and give a quick grammar lesson.  In Section
\ref{sec:science}, we present a physical interpretation of our data
and show a Table example.  Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}
we conclude.

\section{OBSERVATIONS}
\label{sec:observations}

We observed exoplanets, many of them.  Sometimes we deal with theory,
but most of the time we reduce data.

This text shows how to cite other people's papers.
\citet{HarringtonEtal2006sciuandbphas} is a citation to a paper.
Citations can also be in parenthesis
\citep[e.g.,][]{HarringtonEtal2007natHD149026b}.  Multiple papers can
be cited in one go \citep{StevensonEtal2010natGJ436b,
  StevensonEtal2012apjHD149026b, StevensonEtal2012apjGJ436c,
  BlecicEtal2013apjWASP14b, BlecicEtal2014apjWASP43b,
  CubillosEtal2013apjWASP8b, CubillosEtal2014apjTrES1,
  CampoEtal2011apjWASP12b, NymeyerEtal2011apjWASP18b}.

The references information is kept in bibtex format.  Bibtex entries
are generally obtained from
\href{http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html}{ADS}, and
should be stored in a bibfile (see `bibfile-template.bib').


\section{DATA ANALYSIS}
\label{sec:dataanalysis}

\subsection{Compiling LaTeX}
\label{sec:compile}

To properly compile a latex document that uses bibtex you need to run
these set of commands: \newline

\indent \texttt{latex $\triangleright$ bibtex $\triangleright$ latex
  $\triangleright$ latex $\triangleright$ latex} \newline

The multiple latex calls are necessary to let LaTeX properly set the
cross references.  However, if you include these functions
into your bash file (\sim/.bashrc for Unix, or \sim/.bash\_profile for OSX): \\

\footnotesize \noindent
latexcl()\{ rm -f \$*.bbl \$*.blg \$*.dvi \$*.log \$*.aux \$*.ps \$*.pdf; \} \\
lblll()\{ latex \$* ; bibtex \$* ; latex \$* ; latex \$* ; latex \$*; \} \\
pspdfembed()\{ ps2pdf -dMaxSubsetPct=100 -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 -dSubsetFonts=true -dEmbedAllFonts=true \$*; \} \\
latpdf()\{ dvips -R0 -P pdf -t letter -f \$* | pspdfembed - - > \$*.pdf \& \} \\
latbibdo()\{ latexcl \$*; lblll \$* ; latpdf \$* \& \} \\
latexdo()\{ latexcl \$* ; latex \$* ; latex \$* ; latex \$* ; latpdf \$* \& \} \\
\normalsize

% Here they are clean, so you can include them in your bash:
% latexcl () { rm -f $*.bbl $*.blg $*.dvi $*.log $*.aux $*.ps $*.pdf; }
% lblll () { latex $*; bibtex $*; latex $*; latex $*; latex $*; }
% pspdfembed () { ps2pdf -dMaxSubsetPct=100 -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 -dSubsetFonts=true -dEmbedAllFonts=true $*; }
% latpdf () { dvips -R0 -P pdf -t letter -f $* | pspdfembed - - > $*.pdf & }
% latbibdo () { latexcl $*; lblll $*; latpdf $* & }
% latexdo () { latexcl $*; latex $*; latex $*; latex $*; latpdf $* & }

You can compile the document in one single command, for example: \\
{\tt latbibdo templateApJ} \\

The {\tt top-apj.tex} file contains all the latex headers and
user-defined commands.  See comments in that file for what's going on
there.

\subsection{Figures}
\label{sec:figures}

Figure \ref{fig:writing} depicts the paper writing process.  It is
very useful to keep a record of the source plotting code into the .tex
source file (see comment in the Fig caption), so you can
easily find how you made the plot and make updates.  Because you will
have to re-make the plot. Yes, many times.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, clip]{figs/paperwriting.ps}
\caption{The Paper Publication Process.  The following clause seems to be
  universal: ``The closer you are to finish a paper, the longer it
  takes to make any significant improvement.''  On other news,
  although this figure in particular has a title, in papers, figure titles
  appear as the first sentence fragment of the
  caption, as seen in this caption, rather than at the top of the
  graphic.}
\label{fig:writing}
% SOURCE: /home/patricio/ast/esp01/code/lib/python/xkcd/paperwritting.py
\end{figure}


\subsection{Grammar}
\label{sec:grammar}

And now some grammar: `which' introduces a clause that adds a new fact,
and must be set between commas.  For example: ``There was an earthquake
in Chile, which isn't really any news.''  `That' introduces a clause
that explains or limits, and has no surrounding commas.  For example:
``Class O-stars that lie in the constellation of Orion have small proper
motion.''

Use the ``Oxford'' comma in lists.  For example, ``I love my parents, Lady Gaga, and Humpty Dumpty.'', NOT ``I love my parents, Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty.''

Use a hyphen to connect two adjectives acting as a single adjective on
a noun.  You have a bad-pixel map, not a bad pixel map.  The former is
a map of bad pixels.  The latter could be a pixel map, but a bad one.
The hyphen breaks the ambiguity.  However, do {\em not}\/ use a hyphen
between an adverb and an adjective, as the adverb could never modify
the noun and there is no ambiguity: ``We applied a poorly made mask,''
not, ``we applied a poorly-made mask.''  Note that this is a change in
practice from before 2000 or so.  Also, do not hyphenate inside names
or between a number and its units: ``our 3 hour Markov-Chain Monte
Carlo run,'' not ``our 3-hour Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo run.''


\section{SCIENCE}
\label{sec:science}

This section gives a scientific interpretation of the analyzed data.

The macross provide the unslanted mu, `{\micro}' to be used for units of
values, for example: {\micron} or {\microbar}.
Table \ref{table:parameters} is a table.  Tables are well behaved;
most of the time they appear right (or close to) where you put them.
Figures are not.  The can show up anywhere in the pdf.   Be patient.

\begin{table}[ht]

\caption{\label{table:parameters} Light curve parameters}
\begin{tabular}{lc}

\section{CONCLUSIONS}
\label{sec:conclusions}

These are our conclusions.  Although this example has used a colloquial
dialogue, real papers should use a formal writting style.  After the
conclusions we include some acknowledgments.

\section{BAYESIAN CREDIBLE REGION}
\label{sec:CredRegion}

In the Bayesian context, given the posterior probability density,
$p(\theta|{\bf D})$, of a parameter, $\theta$, given the dataset,
${\bf D}$, the highest posterior density region (or credible
region), $R$, is defined by
\begin{equation}
C = \int\sb{R} {\rm d}\theta\;p(\theta|{\bf D})
\label{eq:CredRegion}
\end{equation}
where C is the probability contained in the credible region.  The
region $R$ is selected such that the posterior probability of any
point inside $R$ is larger than that of any point outside.  We like
Eq.\ (\ref{eq:CredRegion}).
